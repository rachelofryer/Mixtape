    <p>Honorable C-Note<br />
Please don't let nothing get back to me<br />
I've been trying to detach from you<br />
Deep down though, I wanna know about what the fuck you been up to (You been up to)<br />
Old him could have seen that coming<br />
Fuck you I don't need nothing from ya<br />
I was doing pretty good without you<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming)<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming, that a relapse coming)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming, that a relapse coming, relapse)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming)<br />
How'd I get so hung up?<br />
How'd I get so hung up?<br />
I know that a "You up?" text would be fucked up, but I'd be lying if I told you I ain't wanna<br />
We used to talk 'til sun up<br />
Now it's Sunday night, something just ain't right<br />
I done aged but I still got the same vices<br />
Starting to wonder if I'm ever gon' shut up<br />
You the one I wanna hear from<br />
I don't hit back loved ones<br />
What's that on my back? One ton<br />
Weighing on me 'cause I had love once, but it's gone now<br />
What you do when it's, just you<br />
And your bedroom walls feel like they could fall down?<br />
Let 'em fall down<br />
Please don't let nothing get back to me (Back to me)<br />
I've been trying to detach from you<br />
Deep down though, I wanna know about what the fuck you been up to (You been up to)<br />
Old him could have seen that coming<br />
Fuck you I don't need nothing from ya<br />
I was doing pretty good without you<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (It's coming in)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a, that a, that a, that a)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse, that a relapse)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a, that a, that a, that a, ooh)<br />
Do you got somebody new?<br />
Do you got somebody new?<br />
I know that I shouldn't ask for my own sake, but I can't help that I wanna know the truth<br />
But, even if you don't<br />
You ain't gon' tell me if you do<br />
'Cause you don't mind, making me lose my mind<br />
Making me lose my mind<br />
I hope the time I spent back<br />
I tried to brace for impact<br />
But, I still got caught up<br />
Gave it my best, but I'm still not all the<br />
Way over what you did to me<br />
What you did to me<br />
Couldn't say why, but you get to me<br />
But you get to me<br />
(Please don't let me)<br />
Please don't let nothing get back to me (Back to me)<br />
I've been trying to detach from you<br />
Deep down though, I wanna know about what the fuck you been up to (You been up to)<br />
Old him could have seen that coming<br />
Fuck you I don't need nothing from ya<br />
I was doing pretty good without you<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (It's coming in)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a, that a, that a, that a)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse, that a relapse)<br />
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming, that a relapse coming)</span></p>

You can't survive without caffeine<br />

    <p> <div class="intro"> WINTER '20 <br />
     YxUR ARRxGANCE<br />
     AN INTRxDUCTIxN Tx A DIFFERENT ME.<br />
    CRAZY 8'S IN THE BACKSEAT</p></div>


    <p>[Verse 1: EST Gee]<br />
Lame niggas wanna hang with us but ain't bang with us<br />
Slang with us, hanging out the window with them things with us<br />
Gang members, real pain-givers like a train hit 'em<br />
Fuck the game up, me and my niggas ran a train in it<br />
Why they playing with us? They know EST the big mob<br />
Gave so many blues to you, they slide throwing crip signs (This Is The Sound)<br />
Pill poppin', if I did stop then I'd miss Quan<br />
<span id="dots11">...</span><span id="more11">
55 Zoski shooting drive, we ain't scared to die<br />
Casey seen me laid up, made me cry, thought I lost my eye<br />
I don't care who with 'em in that ride, everybody die<br />
You ain't one of mine, a thousand on his mind a hundred timеs<br />
He be lying, he ain't outsidе, popping shit on live<br />
Big slime, I'ma give a dime up for the location<br />
Niggas hoes, we gon' tote these poles, fuck probation<br />

[Verse 2: 42 Dugg]<br />
Thug nigga hate them blood nigga, still a cuz killer<br />
Drug dealer full of 35, we gon' buy him out<br />
Made my first M with CMG, like, "What you buy now?"<br />
All-white, I rock Off White, bitch, that's stock price<br />
Bad bitches spend they last with me, ain't never had one<br />
Thirty bricks for thirty-three a piece, I'm tryna grab one<br />
I'm the bad son, mama say she still love me though<br />
Cameras in the bedroom, it's hard for me to trust these hoes<br />
Fuck these bows, I done seen a ticket selling bricks, nigga<br />
How you serving fiends? Bitch, I only sell to rich niggas<br />
Ass-kissing, baby, keep it pushing, I ain't your last nigga<br />
Fast whips, damn near hit the car, I'm tryna stash shit<br />
Past tense, I got a driver now, but even he know<br />
I keep that nickel on me, so if they whoop me, nigga, keep going<br />
Don't throw them birds to me, [?], I'm like T. Owens<br />
Free yours and free mine<br />
Gotti fightin' a body, bitch, I hope you beat it three times<br />
You fail, we gon' keep trying<br />
Quez been sliding, 'til something killed, he gon' keep sliding<br />
Five double-murders, doggy damn near got a graveyard<br />
Shoutout to the prosecutor, that's the one who saved y'all<br />
Bitch, I'm like, "Who raised y'all?" I don't need no days off<br />
I pick up when that pape' call, bitch<br />

[Verse 3: EST Gee]<br />
Yeah, weak dog, fentanyl involved, make the H strong<br />
Making plays how I made my name, it ain't take long<br />
Droplets of vanilla in my Tech to set the taste off<br />
Pull off make me wait long, I ain't no sitting duck<br />
Second run from scoring with that ice like a hockey puck<br />
If you wanna get down, you gotta sacrifice your life to us<br />
Niggas in that field wearing wires like they mic-ing up<br />
Lackin' got yo' peoples' noodle touched, y'all need to tighten up<br />
We gon' get this money, give a fuck 'bout niggas liking us<br />
Ain't no winning fights with us, you know that we gon' light it up<br />
You better have your pipe or something, you must wanna lose your life or something<br />
Whipping, all niggas work they wrists like they writing something<br />
I brought all my dawgs into that huddle like I'm Mike or something<br />
Police found a face inside a puddle of your lifeless buddy<br />
Better have your head on a swivel while in traffic<br />
Gangster everywhere except my casket<br />
I'm a made man if an opp nigga asking<br />
With traps in every side county close except for Radcliffe, nigga</P>

    <p>Got a lotta new flames, still need 'em blue<br />
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two<br />
New Dawn, no roof, I still see the sky<br />
Peace to my grandma, I can still see my guys<br />
Turned his back, must've felt let down<br />
Heard a down-set-hut, what you gon' bet now?<br />

Bitch really wanna get hired<br />
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson<br />

Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fight<br />
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right<br />
Car too fast, can't stop at no light<br />
I hit the gas, it skrrt and I pull off<br />
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off<br />
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off<br />
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out<br />
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss<br />
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars<br />
Who you know pull up, whole entourage in a foreign?<br />
I got designer for days but it's somethin' about 'em<br />
Go crazy for white Air Force One, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy<br />
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise<br />
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard<br />
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it<br />
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it<br />
Everything that I got, it was made for me<br />
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully<br />
Everybody with me gotta eat<br />
Say your grace with me<br />
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust<br />
Please don't reach for no chain<br />
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect<br />
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang<br />
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank<br />
They greet me at the door by my government name<br />
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change<br />
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah<br />
Right back on it, designer my garments<br />
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down<br />
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down<br />
Goin' number one now, hottest out<br />
Hands down, bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'<br />
I done got rich, everybody my cousin<br />
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother<br />
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter<br />
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another<br />
My mother, she happy now<br />
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated<br />
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes<br />
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately<br />
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis<br />
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement<br />
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper<br />
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust<br />
Please don't reach for no chain<br />
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect<br />
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang<br />
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank<br />
They greet me at the door by my government name (hello?)<br />
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change<br />
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah<br />
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it<br />
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings<br />
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million<br />
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building<br />
Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me<br />
I miss Tev, wish shit was different<br />
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my nigga<br />
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you<br />
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on<br />
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on<br />
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload<br />
Get the head and I'm out, I don't trust hoes<br />
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me<br />
I pray to God my soul to keep<br />
G5, just beat his murder<br />
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt<br />
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous<br />
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust<br />
Please don't reach for no chain<br />
